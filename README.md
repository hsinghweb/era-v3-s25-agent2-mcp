# Agent with MCP Server, MCP Client, and AI Agent

A sophisticated mathematical computation system with integrated PowerPoint visualization capabilities. The system leverages AI-driven natural language processing to perform complex mathematical operations and automatically generate visual presentations of the results. Built with three synergistic components, it offers a seamless workflow from mathematical computation to visual representation.

## Components

### MCP Server (mcp-server.py)
- Provides various mathematical functions including:
  - Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
  - Advanced math functions (power, square root, cube root, factorial, logarithm)
  - Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
  - Special functions (ASCII conversion, exponential sum, Fibonacci sequence)
- PowerPoint automation capabilities:
  - Create and manage presentations
  - Draw shapes (rectangles)
  - Add and format text
  - Automated presentation handling

### MCP Client (mcp-client.py)
- Establishes connection with the MCP server
- Demonstrates usage of server tools
- Example implementation shows:
  - Converting text to ASCII values
  - Calculating exponential sums
  - Creating PowerPoint presentations with results

### AI Agent (ai-agent.py)
- Provides intelligent natural language interface for mathematical operations
- Performs step-by-step mathematical reasoning and problem-solving
- Executes complex mathematical computations with detailed explanations
- Automatically generates PowerPoint visualizations of mathematical results
- Maintains a structured workflow from computation to presentation

## Setup and Usage

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system
2. Run the server:
   ```
   python mcp-server.py dev
   ```
3. Run either the client or AI agent:
   ```
   python mcp-client.py
   # or
   python ai-agent.py
   ```
